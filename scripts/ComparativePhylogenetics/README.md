## Comparative phylogenetic analyses
This folder contains the code and input files for comparative phylogenetic analyses using models of gene family and continuous trait evolution.<br>
<br>
The following subfolders are included:<br>
<br>
<b>AncRec:</b> Commands and input files to reconstruct ancestran gene family sizes using DupliPhy.<br>
<b>CAFE4:</b> Scripts and input files to parameterize a birth-death gene family evolution model in CAFE4. Example command lines for running the scripts are on the readme file.<br>
<b>ContinuousTraitModels:</b> Input files and R scripts used to fit phylogenetic generalized least squares regressions and continuous trait evolutionmodels.<br>
<br>
### Credits:
All scripts in this folder written by Roberto MÃ¡rquez (author).
